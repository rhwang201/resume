{\bf Applications Developer} \hfill {\small July 2014 - Present} \\
{\it C3 Energy}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Designing, implementing, and iterating on a framework for fitting, evaluation,
        and invalidation of machine learning models for smart grid applications.
  \item Writing metrics and analytics to capture utility business logic, such as demand
        response and critical peak pricing, along with general applications code, including
        MapReduce jobs.
  \item Writing UI components for nearly all applications, enhancing UI framework, and
        creating tooling for Platform-as-a-Service applications.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Avionics Software Intern} \hfill {\small May 2013 - August 2013} \\
{\it Space Exploration Technologies}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Developed a tool to help REs analyze telemetry as frequencies across all
        similar tests.
  \item Implemented grouping for telemetry metadata database and front-end visualization.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Teaching Assistant} \hfill {\small Jan 2013 - December 2013} \\
{\it EECS UC Berkeley}

\section{PROJECTS}
{\bf Autonomous Racecar (NATCAR)}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep - 1pt
  \item Designed and developed hardware and software aspects of an autonomous,
        line-seeking racecar that won senior-level design class competition.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Astronomy Picture of the Day New Tab}

\begin{itemize} \itemsep - 1pt
  \item Analyzed political content on Weibo and determined the most influential users.
  \item Found student celebrity-lookalikes quickly using PCA and eigenfaces.
  \item Tour into the Picture: Given a simple picture of a room, and simplified room
        assumptions, used homographies to generate all possible camera views.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Compiler for Python-like Language}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep - 1pt
  \item Wrote a lexer and parser for a statically-typed Python-like language,
      using Bison and Flex.
  \item Performed type inference and semantic rewrites of the abstract
      syntax tree.
  \item Generated code in C++, dealing with Python specific features, such as
      dicts, closures, etc.
\end{itemize}
